# Pong-Game-Java
This Game of Pong was created in the scope of the "Introduction to Software Development" course I took at McGill University.
The purpose of the project was to explore graphics programs, object oriented programming and general software development. The project taught me a lot about the lifecycle of a program, and I was introduced to many debugging techniques. This project was very helpful for me to learn how to implement real life physical problems in a program by using mathematical formulas and scaling real world values such as distance into pixel values.

This project was a great opportunity for me to learn how to program in Java and how to implement graphics programs.
